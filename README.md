# Semester 2 Project
# Artillery Game Project

A turn-based artillery game with physics simulation, level progression, and persistent state saving.

## Architecture Overview

The game follows a component-based architecture with these core systems:

### 1. Game Engine Core
- **GameEngine**: Main controller managing the game loop and subsystems  
- **PhysicsEngine**: Handles projectile trajectories, wind effects, and collisions  
- **Level Manager**: Loads and tracks level progress with multiple targets  
- **StateManager**: Handles save/load functionality  
- **Logger**: Records game events for debugging  

### 2. Game Objects
- **Players**: Control angle/power and alternate turns  
- **Projectiles**: Simulated physics objects affected by wind/gravity  
- **Targets** (Static/Moving): Destructible objects with hit detection  
- **Obstacles** (Circular/Rectangular): Environment collision objects  

## Key Features

### Gameplay Flow
1. **Turn System**:
   - Players take alternating turns  
   - Adjustable angle (0-90Â°) and power (0-100%)  
   - Wind affects projectile trajectory  

2. **Level Progression**:
   - Multiple targets per level (must destroy all to advance)  
   - Environmental obstacles  
   - Progressive difficulty scaling  

3. **State Persistence**:
   - Save at any point (mid-level progress preserved)  
   - Auto-save on level completion  
   - Load previous game sessions  

### Physics Simulation
- Projectile motion with gravity (9.8 m/sÂ²)  
- Wind force affecting trajectory  
- Collision detection
 ## ðŸŽ® How to Play
